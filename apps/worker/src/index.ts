/**
 * Worker entry point + CLI — the port of the Python's
 * `if __name__ == "__main__":` block (lines 2189-2224) and its construction of
 * the global collaborators, which lived at module scope in the Python.
 *
 * `bootstrapEnv()` MUST stay the first statement: PATH and the `PR_AGENT_*`
 * secrets have to be in place before anything reads config. The Python did this
 * at IMPORT time, before its config constants resolved, and ES module imports
 * hoist, so the guarantee has to be made explicitly. It is deliberately NOT
 * inside `runTick` — the brief puts it there, but the Python and env.ts's
 * call-order note both put it at the entry point, and the entry point is where
 * it can be first. (Noted in the task-14 report.)
 *
 * THE SIGTERM HANDLER IS NOT OPTIONAL. The Python installs `_term_handler`
 * (2194-2198) so a cron `kill` releases the lockfile instead of leaving it to
 * be recycled by a PID-liveness check on the next tick. `runTick` reports its
 * lock through `onLockAcquired`; without that seam the handler has nothing to
 * release, and a stale lock wedges every later tick.
